// Route Definiton: More detail under  https://angular.io/api/router/Routes
// Overview here:
// Routing is the mechanism by which users navigate through the application, typically via URLs.
// The Angular Router enables navigation from one view to the next as users perform application tasks.
// The Angular Router is an optional service that presents a particular component view for a given URL.
//
// Here's a breakdown of the code:
// The Routes object is an array of route configurations. Each route is an object with properties like path, component, children, etc.
// path is a string that specifies the URL path for the route.
// component is the component that Angular should use for this route.
// `children` is an array of route definitions for child routes.
// `redirectTo` is used to redirect from one path to another.
// `loadComponent` is a function that dynamically loads a component. This is useful for lazy loading components.
// The ** path is a wildcard that matches any URL. In this case, it's used to handle 404 errors.
//
// Here are some specific routes in the code:
// The `home` route loads the HomeComponent.
// The `overview` route loads the OverviewComponent and has a child route :id/detail that loads the DetailComponent.
// The `impressum` route loads the ImpressumComponent.
// The `somewhatever` and ** routes dynamically load the FourZeroFourComponent.
// The empty path '' redirects to home.
//
